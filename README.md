## HELP

### What is Github?
Github is a a place where we **store data**, mainly text based (code and documentation). It can also store images and videos.

Github uses a technology called **git**, a **version control** technology to help keep history of changes to text.

Git **records** every **change** you make to a text, allowing you do **undo everything**, and see who changed what line at what time and why.

Git uses the term **commit** for changes. It is similar to using the **Save button** in other programs.


### Why should we add our users here?
By having all our users on Github, we can manage them into multiple Teams.

Each Team can have access to repositories, and be allowed to **login to websites**. 

**Example:** All members of the team called **Employees** can log into our [Grafana monitoring](https://grafana.fab.city) service by clicking the 'Sign in with Github' button. (No need to create additional login / password.)

We could use this for more services to make user management easier.


### How to edit files on Github

1. Make sure you have selected the correct file by clicking it in the repository
2. Click the **pencil** (edit) button on the right :pencil:

3. Make your changes 
4. Click the green **Commit Changes** button :heavy_check_mark:


### How do I make changes to our main website fablabbcn.org
* Our [main website](https://fablabbcn.org) is 100% open with all it's content on [Github](https://github.com/fablabbcn/fablabbcn-web)
* We host our page on Github Pages 
   * Every git commit to the repository will automatically go to the live page (within a minute)
* Github Pages use a Static Website generator called Jekyll
   * Jekyll has [Video Walkthroughs](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/video-walkthroughs/) - Watch them to learn the basics!
* We are also trying out [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) and CloudCannon to handle (abstract) adding content to the website
