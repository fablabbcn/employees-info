# Employee information


If you are a new employee at FabLab Barcelona, please do the following:
1. Get a Github account. It's free and only takes a minute!
1. Ask someone who has admin access to add your account to the fablabbcn/organization called 'Employee'. This will give you write access to some repositories, like this one and our main website.
1. Add your details in the fablabbcn-web repo, this file: https://github.com/fablabbcn/fablabbcn-web/blob/gh-pages/_data/employees.yml 
   * Now your information should be available on our About page: https://fablabbcn.org/about_us
